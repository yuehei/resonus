/**
 * Warns, on startup, that Android's battery optimization is restricting the
 * app — the usual reason playback dies in the background, a download stalls or
 * the sleep timer fires late.
 *
 * Asked once per launch, not once ever: the system re-restricts an app by
 * itself after a while without opening it, so «Later» has to mean later.
 * «Don't remind me» is the one that stops it for good (a switch in Settings ›
 * Playback brings it back).
 *
 * Once per launch is counted here, not per mount. This is only on screen with a
 * profile open, so leaving one and going back in builds it again, and it used
 * to ask again on the way: at that moment the settings still on hand are the
 * ones of the profile that left, or the factory ones, and either way the answer
 * given a minute ago was not among them. Turning the warning off, or answering
 * «Don't remind me», did not survive the round trip.
